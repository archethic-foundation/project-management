### Meetings Overshot: 3 meetings

### Observations
- Data Completeness: All the mandatory items to the issues are not mapped (Sprint, Estimate, Owner, Priority, Epic etc.)
- Grooming / Understanding: Issues are getting closed beyond demo meeting. Time after demo is supposed to be used for understanding issues for next sprint and estimation.
