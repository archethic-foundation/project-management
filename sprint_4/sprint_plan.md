# Sprint 4

## Nanda Devi

> 28-Mar-22 to 08-Apr-22

### Goal

#### AE Blockchain:
- Implement a tailored embedded data storage engine 
- Benchmark TPS per node: This benchmark would be the basis to calculate the various other parameters of the AE Blockchain
- Fix the Geolocation patch algorithm and plot the nodes in the 2D World map and further minor additions to the AE Blockchain

#### AE Packaging
- Complete snap deployment in Linux. (also test the snap package built until now)

#### AE Biometrics: 
- Build the software to read the fingerprint using Cryptoauthlib and ATECC608A
- Development of the Minutiae extraction AI algorithm using F-Net

#### AE Web
- Inform the user of the transaction fees (in UCO and USD) of the AEWeb
- Support nested html page analysis

#### AE Website
- Rework AE Website based on feedback of the community and provide the archethic-assets repo on Github with all the assets.

### Target
- Total Issues: 17
- Total Story Points: 212

#### Carry Forwards
- Issues carried from last sprint: 7| Story Points: 115
- Issues carried from last 2 sprints: 4| Story Points: 80
