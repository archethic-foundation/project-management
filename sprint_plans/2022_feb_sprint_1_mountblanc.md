# Sprint 1

## Mount Blanc

> 14-Feb-2022 to 25-Feb-2022

### Goal

#### AE Blockchain: 
- Deploy the Metric Dashboard (commonly called as Telemetry)
- Develop further the beacon chain and self-repair mechanism
- Understand the transaction/transaction chain's behaviour (max size + timeouts)

#### AE Biometrics: 
- Explore the latest edge detection techniques for the fingerprint and provide some AI approaches. 

#### AEWeb:
- Through CLI deploy files/folders on Archethic Blockchain


### Target
- Total Issues: 19
- Total Story Points: 131
